Howdy mates! Y'all may call me Globall! Just an little advice: The site's in portuguese.
Firstly, i'd like to say that if you're seeing this, it means that you're interested in my repository, and that's just... Wow!
I mean, this was supposed to be just a normal science fair site. Not something SPECIAL or something like that.
But... Oh me oh my, i don't even know what to say...
Well, eh, i think that's it!
Hope you like it!
Good luck, and thanks for reading!
XOXO, GloballCode
